# tab-manager
A tab manager browser extension, which opens multiple tabs at a time for increased productivity. This product is designed to optimize a user’s tab managing experience. Bookmarking web pages on a search engine isn’t a foreign concept to those who browse the internet on a regular basis. However, that experience can be optimized with the use of a tab manager that can open multiple tabs simultaneously and is able to automate sign in protocols for web pages that require account login information. The tab manager also enables the user to group tabs that are related by subject. This is useful for those who need specific web pages to open during specific internet activities. For example, if the user wanted to conduct research on cars, they can simultaneously open bookmarked web pages that are about cars with the click of a single button. Or, someone working from home may have their work sites pulled up as well as their slack and can open all of these with a single click, saving time.
